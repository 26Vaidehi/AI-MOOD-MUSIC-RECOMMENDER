Here's a well-structured and professional README for your AI Mood-Based Music Recommender project using Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS:

🎶 AI Mood-Based Music Recommender
"Transforming Emotions into Music with AI"

This AI-powered system analyzes facial expressions, voice tone, and text input to detect emotions and recommend songs accordingly. It integrates with Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music to curate mood-based playlists in real time.

🚀 Why This Project?
🔹 Existing recommendation systems rely on past listening history, ignoring real-time emotions.
🔹 Music influences mental health—personalized playlists improve well-being.
🔹 No manual searching—AI instantly finds songs based on your mood.

✨ Key Features
✅ Real-time Emotion Detection (Facial, Speech, & Text Analysis)
✅ Seamless Integration (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music)
✅ Multi-Modal AI (Voice, Text, & Facial Analysis)
✅ Adaptive Learning (Improves recommendations over time)
✅ Personalized Mood Playlists
